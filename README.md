# Firebird Robotics Scouting App (iOS)
This is the code for the iOS version of the Firebird Robotics Scouting App.

### The link to the app can be found here:
https://apps.apple.com/us/app/firebird-robotics-scouting-app/id1473905655

Essentially, the iOS app version is simply a link to the url of the actual online app (which is made in HTML/CSS/PHP/SQL/JS). It's a very simple few lines of code, and didn't require much effort on my part. 

TBH it's basically just the same as opening up safari/chrome on your phone and going to the URL... only difference is that you don't have to type in the URL.

If it's not working for you, there are likely two reasons:
1) The online URL of the app has been changed, and the iOS app needs a new release (in which the URL is updated)
2) The actual app itself isn't working. You can check this by just going to the url.
